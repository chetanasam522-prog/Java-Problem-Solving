# Java Problem Solving

-This repository contains Java programs for problem solving and basic DSA practice.
It focuses on building strong fundamentals and logical thinking using Core Java concepts.
I solve problems regularly while following a structured learning approach,
covering both basic and intermediate Java topics useful for interviews and academics.
The goal of this repository is to strengthen problem-solving skills,
maintain clean and organized code, and track my long-term Java learning progress.
